# **FeeMent – A Click Pays All**
Since the first day of enrolling a kid in school, parents have a lot of business to do with the front office which ranges from school fees, Field trips, After care payments etc. This results in a lot of visits to schools. Just imagine in the Active/Pickup times (1st/2nd Week of resumption) waiting in line (Schools or Banks) for several minutes just to make payments.

Although, e-portal has become a force to reckon with in schools in recent times, yet there has been limitation in the use of such portal applications. For this reason, FeeMent, a complete payment solution that serves to automate students’ payment processes is being presented.

## **Problems**
Education Industry in Nigeria is one of those industries where digitalization is not taking place at the pace at which it is supposed to. Despite of booming internet, 
- About 75% of the 250,000 public and private K12 schools in Nigeria don’t have a website, and parents still have to visit schools or banks to pay their fees.
- About 72% of the 130,000 public and private K12 schools websites in Nigeria cannot collect online payments.
- Parents have to visit each kid school portal to make payment.
- The payment process have to be repeated for each kid and bank charges/processing fee would be deducted for each payment made.
- 75% of the money that flows into the school front office are collected in cash and cheque.
- For parents, that’s needless millions of school visits and for the school back office, it’s a lot of million work writing receipts, filling up deposit summary, trips to the banks, and the regular misappropriation, stolen or lost of funds.
